    <p>The Foothill Flyers Disc Golf Club and BOERA are excited to bring you the 4th annual PCSD Disc Golf Fundraiser. This will be a sanctioned C-Tier event held at 1 course, Bailey DGC, located at 599 Rosalie Rd. Bailey, CO. The purpose of this event is to raise money for PCSD for all they do in maintaining and allowing us all to play Bailey DGC almost year round. We have some exciting projects planned for the course this year following up on the huge success of the DiscGolfPark turf pads installed in 2018. UPDATE (6/5) We will have brand new DiscGolfPark baskets installed in time for this tournament!!!</p>
    <p>2 round tournament for all Pro, Advanced, and Intermediate divisions and a 1 round tournament for all Recreational players and Juniors. Non-PDGA member fees ($10) will be waived since this tournament falls under the competition endowment program for 401(c) 3s.
    Awards for Rec players and Juniors will be after round 1. Awards for all other divisions will follow round 2 after all scores are counted. 50% of the Pro pool will go to CASH PAYOUTS for the PROS and the other 50% goes to the PCSD fundraiser. All AM divisions will also receive payouts in the form of merchandise.</p>

    <p>BOERA will be providing lunch for all players. (Hot dogs and such). We are still in the process of securing a disc sponsor for the tournament. The one and only Dave Ross will be doing artwork for the tournament discs, so you know it's going to be sick! All AMs will be receiving one sweet custom stamped disc and I'm sure we'll have all kinds of other goodies to give away.
